# Pokemon Data Engineering Challenge

Welcome to my entry for the #dataengineeringchallenge! ðŸš€ This project showcases my skills in data scraping and SQL database management by gathering comprehensive Pokemon data from [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all).

## Project Overview

## Mechanics

Data Scraping: Extracts Pokemon details including number, name, type, and stats from PokemonDB.  
Database Management: Stores the scraped data in an SQL database (.db or .sqlite) for efficient retrieval and management.

## Technologies Used

Python for web scraping (Beautiful Soup, Requests)  
SQL (SQLite) for database management

## Usage

-Clone this repository.  
-Run the Python notebook script pokedex.ipynb to scrape data.  
i suggest running this in [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com) so you won't need to install anything locally.  
-Data will be stored in pokedex.db.  
-Use SQL queries to explore and analyze the data.
